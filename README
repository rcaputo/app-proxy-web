This is a POE-based streaming web proxy, with content rewriting and
filtering, among other things.  It started out as a combined web proxy
and IRC bot, and it may have some vestiges of the IRC client
remaining.

The intent is to work this into a proper web proxy, then release it as
a CPAN module and application.
